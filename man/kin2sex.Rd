\arguments{
\item{pf}{numeric. A vector (atomic) or  matrix with female probabilities (or survival ratios, or transition between age class in a more general perspective) with rows as ages (and columns as years in case of matrix, being the name of each col the year).}

\item{pm}{numeric. A vector (atomic) or  matrix with male probabilities (or survival ratios, or transition between age class in a more general perspective) with rows as ages (and columns as years in case of matrix, being the name of each col the year).}

\item{ff}{numeric. Same as pf but for fertility rates.}

\item{fm}{numeric. Same as pm but for fertility rates.}

\item{time_invariant}{logical. Constant assumption for a given \code{year} rates. Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{sex_focal}{character. "f" for female or "m" for male.}

\item{birth_female}{numeric. Female portion at birth. This multiplies \code{f} argument. If \code{f} is already for female offspring, this needs to be set as 1.}

\item{pif}{numeric. For using some specific age distribution of childbearing for mothers (same length as ages). Default \code{NULL}.}

\item{pim}{numeric. For using some specific age distribution of childbearing for fathers (same length as ages). Default \code{NULL}.}

\item{nf}{numeric. Same as pf but for population distribution (counts or \verb{\%}). Optional.}

\item{nm}{numeric. Same as pm but for population distribution (counts or \verb{\%}). Optional.}

\item{output_cohort}{integer. Vector of year cohorts for returning results. Should be within input data years range.}

\item{output_period}{integer. Vector of period years for returning results. Should be within input data years range.}

\item{output_kin}{character. kin types to return: "m" for mother, "d" for daughter,...}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item{kin_full}{ a data frame with year, cohort, Focal´s age, related ages and type of kin (for example \code{d} could be daughter or son depending \code{sex_kin},
\code{oa} is older aunts or uncles also depending \code{sex_kin} value, etc.), including living and dead kin at that age.}
\item{kin_summary}{ a data frame with Focal´s age, related ages, sex and type of kin, with indicators obtained processing \code{kin_full}, grouping by cohort or period (depending on the given arguments):}
{\itemize{
\item{\code{count_living}}{: count of living kin at actual age of Focal}
\item{\code{mean_age}}{: mean age of each type of living kin.}
\item{\code{sd_age}}{: standard deviation of age of each type of living kin.}
\item{\code{count_death}}{: count of dead kin at specific age of Focal.}
\item{\code{count_cum_death}}{: cumulated count of dead kin until specific age of Focal.}
\item{\code{mean_age_lost}}{: mean age where Focal lost her relative.}
}
}
}
}
\description{
Implementation of two-sex matrix kinship model. This produces kin counts grouped by kin, age and sex of
each relatives at each Focal´s age. For example, male cousins from aunts and uncles from different sibling's parents
are grouped in one male count of cousins. Note that the output labels relative following female notation: the label \code{m}
refers to either mothers or fathers, and column \code{sex_kin} determine the sex of the relative.
